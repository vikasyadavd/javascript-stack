# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed, similar to a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

## Key Properties

1. **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) Order:** Elements are removed in the reverse order of their insertion.

2. **Elements:** A stack can store a collection of elements of any data type.

3. **Operations:** Stacks support two primary operations:
   - **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
   - **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.

4. **Peek or Top:** Allows you to examine the top element without removing it.

5. **Size:** You can determine the number of elements in a stack using the size property.

6. **Empty Stack:** A stack is considered empty when it contains no elements.

7. **Overflow:** Some implementations may have a maximum capacity.

8. **Underflow:** Attempting to pop from an empty stack can result in an underflow condition.

9. **Implementation:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

10. **Use Cases:** Stacks are used in various applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, and parsing operations.

11. **Efficiency:** Basic stack operations (push, pop, peek) typically have a constant time complexity of O(1).

## Examples

Here are some code examples demonstrating how to implement and use a stack in different programming languages:
